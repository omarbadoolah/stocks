# Goals

Our goal is to invest our savings in a halal manner using stocks. 
When we say "stocks", we mean trading (i.e. buying and selling) shares of publicly traded companies on the stock market. 
The "stock market" we participate in is primarily the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and NASDAQ in the United States.

To accomplish this goal:
* We will use a process to determine if a company and its business are compliant with Islamic Shariah or if there are parts or all of their business that are haraam.
* Invest (i.e. buy) on a periodic basis, using a process to determine which "halal" stocks to purchases.
* Sell when it appears that the risk of a price decline is greater than a price increase or when there is a better opportunity.

# History

Success is making money (i.e. selling for more than we purchased in the aggregate) *and* at least keeping pace with the market. 
Keeping pace with the market or "market" returns is defined by the price appreciation of stock indices:

Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA)
: A price weighted index of 30 top public companies selected by Dow Jones. It's also known as "the Dow".

S&P 500
: A market capitilization weighted index of the top 500 US public companies (by market capitilization). It's also known as "the S&P".

NASDAQ
: A market capitilization weighted index of *ALL* of the companies listed on the NASDAQ exchange.

While there are many other indices, these three are the most popular for gauging the overall health of the market.
The Dow is popular for historical reasons.
The S&P is considered more accurate because it weights each company by its size. Therefore, price changes in larger companies have a larger impact than price increases in smaller companies.
The NASDAQ usually list more tech companies and therefore gives a better indication how the tech sector is performing. The performance of the tech sector can be a leading indicator for the rest of the economy as:
* Today's tech companies become tomorrow's industrial leaders.
* New technologies proliferate to 
  * other companies and industries and make them more profitable 
  * other new technologies and companies
